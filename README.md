# maize_knob_sequences
because I keep forgetting where to find them

## Knob 180

1. Searched NCBI nucleotide with `(maize knob) AND "Zea mays"[porgn:__txid4577]`

2. Took only sequences 

3. I removed any fasta entry that contained an "N," as I was concerned about poor quality sanger sequence (there are still some indels as is!)

4. removed all sequence before `GGCCACA`, aligned by eye, and trimmed sequence reentering `GGCCACA`

##### these are in `knob180.fa`

##### also have Tripsacum knob 180 sequences in `tripsacum_knob180.fa`

NCBI search query:
`(maize knob) AND "Tripsacum dactyloides"[porgn:__txid4563]`


## Tr-1 Knobs are a bit messier `Tr1_knob.fa`

I kept the one sequence with an N because there were so few of them
